To add extra voices using the file "Batch_Add_All_Available_English_Voices.reg"

You must first download and install the following extra voices in your windows 10 speech voices:

Windows->Speech->Manage voices->Add Voices (button)

English (Australia)
English (Canada)
English (India)
English (Ireland)
English (United Kingdom)
English (United State)

After they have downloaded and installed you can double click the registry file to add the keys necessary for the voices to be recognised by the bot.

Disclaimer:

This worked for me on a GB install of windows 10. I assume it will also work for other installs that contain all the above english voice packs.
These files add extra keys for each voice to your registry. This might cause problems for your system if you don't have any of these voice packs installed.
After you have installed these voices if you discover that some of the !voices do not speak properly then you will need to either
reinstall that voice pack or remove these added registry keys. You can do this manually with regedit or with a registry cleaning software such as ccleaner.
